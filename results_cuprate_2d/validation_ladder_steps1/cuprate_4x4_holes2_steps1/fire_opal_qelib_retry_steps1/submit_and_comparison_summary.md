# 4x4 Fire Opal qelib retry summary

Submitted on 2026-07-04 for the existing 4x4 validation run:

- case: `results_cuprate_2d/validation_ladder_steps1/cuprate_4x4_holes2_steps1`
- route: Fire Opal qelib retry, `number_preserving_t_only`, step 1, `dt = 0.1`
- backend: `ibm_marrakesh`
- main action: `2331685`, status `SUCCESS`
- readout action: `2331686`, status `SUCCESS`
- note: the earlier abstract/native retry produced action `2331683` for main but it ended as `FAILURE`; its readout action was `2331684`.

Fire Opal emitted a warning that the qelib circuit may already have undergone preprocessing/transpilation, so Q-CTRL performance gains may be limited. The qelib route is therefore a diagnostic fallback, not the preferred abstract input.

## Artifacts

- Fire Opal summary: `cuprate_2d_fire_opal_summary.md`
- Fire Opal raw results: `fire_opal_raw_results.json`
- Observable comparison: `../observable_comparison_shallow_t_only_steps1_vs_mps_fire_opal_qelib_retry/cuprate_2d_observable_comparison.md`
- Sector-conditioned comparison: `../sector_conditioned_fire_opal_qelib_retry_steps1_vs_mps/sector_conditioned_report.md`

Interpretation boundary: these are diagonal-observable hardware diagnostics for the shallow 4x4 circuit family. The exact-sector Fire Opal row is much closer to the MPS circuit baseline than direct IBM, but it is postselected and keeps only about 25 percent of shots; it is not a standalone physical claim.
