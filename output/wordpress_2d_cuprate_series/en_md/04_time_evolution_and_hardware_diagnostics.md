# Fermi-Hubbard 2D cuprate series, part 4: time evolution and hardware diagnostics

The 3x3 run is where hardware first enters the 2D route. Because exact ED is
available, the hardware output can be treated properly: not as a standalone
result, but as a diagnostic signal compared against exact and approximate local
baselines.

The main question is simple:

how close are IBM and Fire Opal to the same exact observable values?

## Circuit depth matters immediately

The shallow 3x3 route reduced the IBM-transpiled step-1 resources to:

- logical depth: `8`
- transpiled IBM depth: `167`
- two-qubit count: `159`
- two-qubit depth: `52`

For the Fire Opal qelib step-1 route, the exported circuit had:

- exported depth: `25`
- CX count: `66`
- two-qubit depth: `10`

These numbers already explain part of the result. Fire Opal is not just a
different postprocessing label. It changes the hardware route enough that the
effective circuit presented to the device is much easier.

## Step-by-step hardware comparison

The hardware comparison below is sector-conditioned against exact full ED.

| step | route | exact-sector survival | charge RMSE | spin-z RMSE | doublon RMSE |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | IBM exact-sector | 0.224609 | 0.072170 | 0.098797 | 0.038610 |
| 1 | Fire Opal exact-sector | 0.567568 | 0.012651 | 0.019293 | 0.010273 |
| 2 | IBM exact-sector | 0.137695 | 0.123534 | 0.233135 | 0.073125 |
| 2 | Fire Opal exact-sector | 0.332692 | 0.035551 | 0.074967 | 0.027467 |
| 3 | IBM exact-sector | 0.146484 | 0.079577 | 0.182239 | 0.036406 |
| 3 | Fire Opal exact-sector | 0.216972 | 0.031717 | 0.074023 | 0.023461 |

The pattern is clear:

- Fire Opal is systematically closer to exact ED than direct IBM.
- Fire Opal has much higher exact-sector survival at step 1.
- Sector survival still decays with time.
- By step 3, the hardware result is still diagnostic, not a final physical
  answer.

## Why sector survival is central

The intended circuit family is number-preserving. The physical sector is part
of the model definition. If a large fraction of shots leave the expected
particle sector, the measured observables mix physical dynamics with noise.

Postselecting the exact sector can improve RMSE, but it also reduces the
number of usable shots. That tradeoff matters:

- without postselection, leakage contaminates the observable;
- with exact-sector postselection, statistics may become thin;
- near-sector analysis can show whether errors are small particle-number
  defects or completely off-sector noise.

For the 3x3 time sweep, Fire Opal begins with much better sector survival than
direct IBM, but the survival still falls from about `0.568` at step 1 to about
`0.217` at step 3.

That is the strongest warning from this run. Better mitigation is useful, but
longer time evolution still needs shallower circuits and better protection of
the particle sector.

## What the time evolution says physically

The exact 3x3 time evolution shows early spin melting and doublon formation.
Mean absolute spin-z decreases from `0.888889` at step 0 to `0.674849` at step
4. Mean doublon rises from `0.000000` to about `0.064354` by step 4.

TDHF follows the early diagonal observables surprisingly well, especially at
step 1 and step 2. That does not make TDHF exact. It means that for this small
early-time window, the measured observables are not yet maximally sensitive to
correlations beyond mean field.

The Gaussian/free baseline diverges faster, especially in spin-z and doublon.
That is useful because it shows the chosen observables do see interaction
effects over the time sweep.

## The interpretation boundary

The hardware data should be read as hardware diagnostics:

- IBM direct hardware shows significant noise and leakage.
- Fire Opal improves the 3x3 result substantially.
- Neither route removes the need for exact comparison.
- Longer time evolution is limited by sector survival and circuit depth.

The right conclusion is not "the hardware solved 2D Hubbard". The right
conclusion is that the 3x3 validation run can distinguish better and worse
hardware routes on physically defined observables.

That is exactly what this run was built to do.
